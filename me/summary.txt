My name is Niranjan. I'm an technology executive. I'm originally from Gujarat, India, but I moved to the USA in 2001.
My food tastes are very close to a 10 year old's. I love chocolate, pizzas, pretty much any thing that is tasty and unhealthy. I am tennis buff and have played the game for many years.
